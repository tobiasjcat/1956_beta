According to rumors, he also broke the Stalin's pipe! \n\nConfronting Stalin is a dangerous adventure and Genden, understanding this, is not sure, whether this should be included in the official report to the Committee in Ulaanbaatar.

Extreme division of a party has lead to rightists capitalistic reforms of 1926-1928 and to devastation caused by the far-leftist approach to collectivization of 1928-1932. \n\nDrastic government changes are having a negative impact on lifes of our people. Constant shift of political compass might be explained by many factors, yet the main reason is clear: our party is infiltrated by the foreign agents and collaborators of [JAP.GetNameDef] or [CHI.GetNameDef]. This can't be tolerated and few suspicius members might need to removed from the government in one way or another."

Such massive power block cannot be neglected: rebellions of 1932 and Lhumbe plot of 1933 clearly indicate the need of intervention before the situation becomes too tense. Luckily, we already have an experience with limiting llama's power since Choibalsan rise to power. \n\nStaying loyal to the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, their leader [SOV.GetLeader] and principles of communism implies that we shall conduct this operation as soon as possible."
